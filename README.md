# Naive Bayes Assignment

In this assignment we use Naive Bayes (NB) for its two greatest strengths: 
1. Exploration of a data set 
1. Classification of new data based on training data

Note: this assignment makes use of data stored in databases. If you have had
ADA, then I'd expect you to write the SQL code yourself. If you haven't, 
feel free to use some of the queries I've posted in `SQL Help.ipynb`, at
least as starting points. 

The databases are not small, so I'm going to share them via a dropbox link.
You should be able to access the file 
[here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mwhd2ktvtnyapwx/nb-assignment-data.zip?dl=0).

When you get that file, just extract the contents manually into the same
folder as this repository.
